		<p>The Audi e-tron GT quattro is a modern-day demonstration of progress. It radiates sportiness, exclusivity and comfort. Its aerodynamic design and gran turismo concept are an irresistible eye-catcher. Driving it is a thoroughly emotional experience.</p>

		<p>Never before has an RS model been so full of energy as the Audi RS e-tron GT. Its technical brilliance goes far beyond anything that can be expressed as performance data. These values are what defines this top-of-the-line Audi model’s thoroughly forward-looking characteristics. The Audi RS e-tron GT combines performance and progressiveness without compromise. Characteristic: RS emblems with the red rhombus as a symbol of superb performance.</p>

		<p>The 800-volt lithium-ion battery integrated into the flat underbody of the Audi e-tron GT, which has a gross capacity of 93.4 kWh, offers extremely high performance compared to today’s 400-volt systems – both when charging and when driving.</p>
